🚨 DIAGNOSTIC CHECK REQUIRED
=====================================

The "Staff not found" error means your database connection is failing OR your staff table is empty.

IMMEDIATE STEPS:
=====================================

1. Open your browser and go to:
   https://holykids-timer-1.onrender.com/api/diagnostic
   
   (Replace with your actual deployed URL)

2. Check the response:
   - environment.hasSupabaseUrl: should be true
   - environment.hasSupabaseKey: should be true
   - database.connected: should be true
   - database.staffCount: should be > 0

3. If hasSupabaseUrl or hasSupabaseKey is FALSE:
   → Your environment variables are NOT set on Render
   → Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service → Environment
   → Add:
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

4. If database.connected is FALSE:
   → Check the error message
   → Verify your Supabase URL and key are correct
   → Check if Supabase project is active

5. If staffCount is 0:
   → Your staff table is EMPTY
   → Go to Supabase → Table Editor → staff table
   → Add at least one staff member manually
   → Or use the "Add Staff" button in the admin panel

COMMON ISSUES:
=====================================
- Environment variables not set on deployment platform
- Supabase project paused/inactive
- Staff table empty
- Wrong Supabase URL/key
- RLS policies blocking access

CHECK THIS NOW!
