✅ TYPES MODULE FIXED - PERMANENT SOLUTION
==========================================

PROBLEM:
- Vercel build failing with: "Cannot find module '@/types'"
- CheckInData interface was imported but types file didn't exist

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- No types folder or file existed in the project
- Path alias @/types was configured but pointed to non-existent directory
- AttendanceService methods had incorrect signatures

PERMANENT FIX APPLIED:
======================

1️⃣ CREATED TYPES MODULE
   ✅ Created types/index.ts with all shared type definitions:
      - CheckInData interface
      - CheckOutData interface  
      - AttendanceRecord interface
      - StaffMember interface

2️⃣ UPDATED TSCONFIG.JSON
   ✅ Added both path aliases:
      - "@/types": ["./types"]
      - "@/types/*": ["./types/*"]
   ✅ Ensures module resolution works correctly

3️⃣ FIXED ATTENDANCE SERVICE
   ✅ Updated getTodayAttendance() to accept optional staff_id parameter
   ✅ Updated checkIn() method to:
      - Accept CheckInData-compatible object
      - Return Promise with success/error structure
      - Match API route expectations

4️⃣ VERIFIED .GITIGNORE
   ✅ Confirmed types folder is NOT ignored
   ✅ File will be included in Git and deployed to Vercel

COMMITS PUSHED TO GITHUB:
==========================
✅ Commit ab322a3: "Fix: Add types folder with CheckInData interface and update tsconfig"
✅ Commit 3021fc8: "Fix: Update AttendanceService to support optional staff_id parameter and new checkIn signature"

VERCEL DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
=========================
🚀 Code is pushed to GitHub
🚀 Vercel will auto-deploy from commit 3021fc8
🚀 Build should now succeed

WHAT WAS FIXED:
===============
✅ Missing types module created
✅ Path aliases configured correctly
✅ Type definitions match usage across codebase
✅ AttendanceService API matches route expectations
✅ All files committed and pushed to GitHub
✅ No temporary workarounds - permanent solution

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Wait for Vercel to detect new commits and auto-deploy
2. Monitor Vercel build logs for success
3. If build succeeds, test the application
4. If any new errors appear, fix them iteratively

This is a PERMANENT fix, not a temporary workaround.
All type safety is maintained.
No TypeScript errors are suppressed.
