WHY IT ASKS FOR "PASSKEY"
========================================

Don't worry! This is NORMAL and CORRECT.

"Passkey" is just the modern name for:
✓ Fingerprint (on phones)
✓ Face ID (on iPhone)
✓ Touch ID (on Android)

You DON'T need a USB key!

========================================
WHAT TO DO:
========================================

When it says "Use your passkey":
1. Just place your finger on the sensor
2. That's it!

Your phone's fingerprint = passkey

========================================
THE PROCESS:
========================================

ENROLLMENT (One-time setup):
1. Add staff in Staff Management
2. Click "Setup" under Biometric
3. Phone says: "Use your passkey"
4. Place finger on sensor
5. Done! ✅

CLOCK-IN (Daily use):
1. Go to Clock In page
2. Click "Scan Fingerprint"
3. Phone says: "Use your passkey"
4. Place finger on sensor
5. Success! Shows name and time
6. Auto-resets for next person

========================================
WHY THIS IS BETTER:
========================================

✓ No passwords to remember
✓ No USB keys to carry
✓ Just use your fingerprint
✓ Fast and secure
✓ Fingerprint never leaves your phone

========================================
IMPORTANT:
========================================

"Passkey" = Your fingerprint
NOT a USB security key
NOT a password
NOT an external device

Just your phone's built-in fingerprint sensor!

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================

If it keeps asking for passkey:
1. Make sure fingerprint is set up in phone settings
2. Go to: Settings > Security > Fingerprint
3. Add at least one fingerprint
4. Try enrollment again

If fingerprint doesn't work:
1. Use "Use PIN Instead" option
2. Enter the 4-digit PIN
3. Clock in successfully

========================================

1. Add a staff member
2. Click "Setup" biometric
3. Use YOUR fingerprint
