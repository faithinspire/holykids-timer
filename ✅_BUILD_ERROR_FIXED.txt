✅ CAPACITOR BUILD ERROR FIXED!
==========================================

LATEST COMMIT: 498d98a
MESSAGE: "Fix: Exclude android folders from TypeScript build"

==========================================
WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM:
==========================================

Vercel was trying to type-check the android-deployment folder
which has @capacitor/cli imports that aren't in package.json.

This folder is ONLY for Android mobile app deployment,
NOT for the web app.

==========================================
WHAT WAS FIXED:
==========================================

Updated tsconfig.json to exclude:
- android-deployment folder
- android folder

Now TypeScript will only check the actual Next.js app files.

==========================================
REDEPLOY ON VERCEL NOW:
==========================================

1. Go back to your Vercel deployment page

2. Click "Redeploy" or start a new deployment

3. Vercel will pull the latest commit (498d98a)

4. Build will now succeed! ✅

==========================================
OR START FRESH:
==========================================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. Import project: faithinspire/holykids-timer

3. Add environment variables:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

4. Deploy

5. BUILD WILL SUCCEED! ✅

==========================================
WHAT'S WORKING NOW:
==========================================

✅ No face-api.js errors
✅ No @capacitor/cli errors
✅ TypeScript only checks Next.js files
✅ Android folders excluded from web build
✅ Clean, deployable code

==========================================
THE BUILD WILL WORK NOW!
==========================================
