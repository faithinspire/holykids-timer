✅ DEPARTMENT TYPE MISMATCH FIXED!
==========================================

LATEST COMMIT: bc84088
MESSAGE: "Fix: Update StaffMember interface to support string array for department"

==========================================
WHAT WAS THE ERROR:
==========================================

Type error: Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'

The StaffMember interface had:
  department: string

But we're using multi-select departments which creates:
  department: string[]

==========================================
WHAT WAS FIXED:
==========================================

Updated StaffMember interface to:
  department: string | string[]

This allows department to be either:
- A single string (for old data)
- An array of strings (for multi-select)

Also added:
  face_enrolled?: boolean

==========================================
ALL ERRORS FIXED:
==========================================

✅ face-api.js removed
✅ @capacitor/cli excluded
✅ All implicit 'any' errors fixed
✅ All forEach callbacks typed
✅ downlevelIteration enabled
✅ Supabase null checks added
✅ Department type mismatch fixed

==========================================
REDEPLOY ON VERCEL NOW:

2. Click "Redeploy"
3. Vercel will pull commit: bc84088
