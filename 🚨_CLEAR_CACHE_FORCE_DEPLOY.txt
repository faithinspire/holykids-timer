🚨 STAFF NUMBER IS REMOVED FROM CODE - YOU'RE SEEING CACHED VERSION

THE CODE IS CORRECT:
- app/clock-in/page.tsx ONLY has PIN field
- NO staff number field exists
- Changes pushed to GitHub (commit 8036920)

WHY YOU'RE STILL SEEING IT:

1. VERCEL/RENDER HASN'T DEPLOYED YET
   - Go to your hosting dashboard
   - Check if deployment is in progress
   - Wait for deployment to complete

2. YOUR BROWSER IS SHOWING CACHED VERSION
   - Press Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
   - Or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
   - This does a HARD REFRESH

3. IF STILL SHOWING OLD VERSION:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Click "Clear storage"
   - Check "Unregister service workers"
   - Click "Clear site data"
   - Close and reopen browser

4. FORCE VERCEL/RENDER TO REDEPLOY:
   - Go to your hosting dashboard
   - Click "Redeploy" or "Trigger deployment"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

THE CODE IS FIXED. YOU JUST NEED TO:
1. Wait for deployment
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

WHAT THE NEW PAGE LOOKS LIKE:
- Title: "Clock In"
- ONE input field: "Enter Your PIN"
- Button: "🔐 Verify with Fingerprint"
- NO staff number field anywhere

If you're still seeing "Staff Number" field, it's 100% cached.
