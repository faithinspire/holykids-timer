✅ GITHUB IS SHOWING THE FIX CORRECTLY!
==========================================

WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS NORMAL AND CORRECT!
==========================================

The GitHub diff you're seeing shows:
- RED LINES (with minus -) = OLD CODE THAT WAS REMOVED ✅
- GREEN LINES (with plus +) = NEW CODE THAT WAS ADDED ✅

The line "import * as faceapi from 'face-api.js'" appears in RED
because it was DELETED from the file. This is EXACTLY what we want!

==========================================
VERIFICATION COMPLETE:
==========================================

✅ NO face-api.js imports in ANY file
✅ NO face-api.js in package.json
✅ Latest commit (c95bfed) has the clean code
✅ Build should now succeed on Vercel/Render

==========================================
WHAT THE DIFF MEANS:
==========================================

Line 8 OLD (REMOVED): import * as faceapi from 'face-api.js'
Line 8 NEW (ADDED):   import LoadingSpinner from '@/components/ui/LoadingSpinner'

This shows we successfully REMOVED the problematic import!

==========================================
READY TO DEPLOY NOW:
==========================================
