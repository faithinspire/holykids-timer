URGENT: CHECK YOUR STAFF API NOW
=====================================

Your admin/staff page is stuck loading with "Staff not found" error.

DO THIS IMMEDIATELY:

1. Open a new browser tab
2. Go to: https://holykids-timer-1.onrender.com/api/staff
3. Tell me EXACTLY what you see

Expected responses:
- {"staff": []} = Table is EMPTY (you need to add staff)
- {"staff": [{...}]} = Staff exists (good)
- {"error": "..."} = Database connection failed
- Nothing/timeout = Server is down

If you see {"staff": []}, your table is EMPTY.
You need to add staff in Supabase manually OR use the Add Staff button.

ALSO CHECK:
Go to: https://holykids-timer-1.onrender.com/api/diagnostic

This will show if your database is connected.

TELL ME WHAT BOTH URLs SHOW!
