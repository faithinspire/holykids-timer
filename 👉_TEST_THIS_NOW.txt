🎯 CAMERA FIXED - NOW DIAGNOSE STAFF LOADING ISSUE

✅ WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Camera capture now more robust
- Better error handling
- Auto-stops camera after capture
- Waits for video to be ready before capture

⚠️ CURRENT ISSUE:
Staff not loading on /admin/staff page

🔧 HOW TO DIAGNOSE:

STEP 1: Visit Test Page
Go to this URL in your browser:
https://holykids-timer-1.onrender.com/test-staff-api

STEP 2: Run Tests
Click both buttons:
1. "Test /api/diagnostic" - Check database connection
2. "Test /api/staff" - Check if staff loads

STEP 3: Report Results
Tell me what you see:
- Is database connected? (Green ✅ or Red ❌)
- Staff count? (Number)
- Any error messages?

🚀 CHANGES DEPLOYED:
All changes are pushed to GitHub and should deploy to Render automatically.
Wait 2-3 minutes, then test.

📝 WHAT TO EXPECT:

If Database Connected + Staff Count > 0:
→ Everything is working! Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

If Database Not Connected:
→ Environment variables missing on Render
→ Need to add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

If Staff Count = 0:
→ Staff table is empty in Supabase
→ Need to add staff members

Once you report the test results, I'll know exactly how to fix it!
