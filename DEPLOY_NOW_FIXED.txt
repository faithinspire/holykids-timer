✅ BUILD ERROR FIXED - READY TO DEPLOY
==========================================

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Removed face-api.js import from face-enrollment page
- All ML libraries removed from package.json
- Build should now succeed on Vercel and Render

LATEST COMMIT: c95bfed
GitHub: https://github.com/faithinspire/holykids-timer

==========================================
DEPLOY TO VERCEL:
==========================================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "Import Project" or "Add New" → "Project"
3. Select your GitHub repository: faithinspire/holykids-timer
4. Add Environment Variables:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = your_supabase_url
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your_anon_key
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = your_service_role_key
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Wait for build to complete (should succeed now!)

==========================================
DEPLOY TO RENDER:
==========================================

1. Go to: https://render.com/dashboard
2. Click "New" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository: faithinspire/holykids-timer
4. Configure:
   - Name: holykids-attendance
   - Environment: Node
   - Build Command: npm install && npm run build
   - Start Command: npm start
5. Add Environment Variables (same as above)
6. Click "Create Web Service"
7. Wait for build to complete

==========================================
WHAT WORKS NOW:
==========================================

✅ PIN Clock-In: /pin-clock-in (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)
   - Staff enters PIN
   - System verifies and records attendance
   - Data saves to Supabase

✅ Face Enrollment: /staff/face-enrollment (MOCK DATA)
   - Camera captures face image
   - Sends to server for processing
   - Currently uses mock embeddings for testing
   - Saves PIN and mock face data to database

✅ Face Clock-In: /face-clock-in (MOCK DATA)
   - Camera captures face image
   - Sends to server for verification
   - Currently uses mock matching (85% threshold)
   - Records attendance if match found

==========================================
NEXT STEPS AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
==========================================

For production-ready facial recognition:
1. Choose a face recognition service:
   - AWS Rekognition
   - Azure Face API
   - Google Cloud Vision API

2. Update these files with real API integration:
   - app/api/face/verify/route.ts (detectAndCompareFace function)
   - app/api/face/enroll/route.ts (detectFaceAndExtractEmbedding function)

3. See SERVER_SIDE_FACE_RECOGNITION.md for integration guide

==========================================
TEST AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
==========================================

1. Visit your deployed URL
2. Test PIN clock-in first (should work perfectly)
3. Test face enrollment (camera should show, capture should work)
4. Test face clock-in (camera should show, mock verification should work)
5. Check admin reports to verify attendance is recorded
