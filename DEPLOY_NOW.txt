5. Try the clock-in page with fingerprint

Your app URL: https://holykids-timer.vercel.app

========================================
WHAT WAS FIXED:
========================================

The error "useTheme must be used within ThemeProvider" 
was happening because pages were being pre-rendered 
without the theme context.

Solution: Added dynamic rendering to all pages that 
use the ThemeToggle component.

========================================

Need help? The changes are ready - just run deploy.bat!
