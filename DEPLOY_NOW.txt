HOLYKIDS - DEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

The build error has been FIXED! 

2 files were updated:
✓ app/clock-in/page.tsx
✓ app/admin/staff/page.tsx  

ThemeToggle now uses dynamic import with SSR disabled.
This prevents the "useTheme must be used within ThemeProvider" error.

========================================
TO DEPLOY - CHOOSE ONE METHOD:
========================================

METHOD 1 (EASIEST):
-------------------
1. Double-click the file: deploy.bat
2. Wait for it to finish
3. Done!


METHOD 2 (COMMAND PROMPT):
--------------------------
1. Press Windows Key + R
2. Type: cmd
3. Press Enter
4. Copy and paste these commands one by one:

cd "C:\Users\OLU\Desktop\my files\TIME ATTENDANCE"
git add .
git commit -m "Fix ThemeToggle SSR issue - use dynamic import"
git push origin main


METHOD 3 (GITHUB DESKTOP):
--------------------------
1. Open GitHub Desktop app
2. You'll see 2 changed files
3. Write commit message: "Fix ThemeToggle SSR issue"
4. Click "Commit to main"
5. Click "Push origin"


========================================
AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
========================================

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to build
2. Check your Vercel dashboard
3. Build should show SUCCESS ✓
4. Test the app on your phone
5. Try the clock-in page with fingerprint

Your app URL: https://holykids-timer.vercel.app

========================================
WHAT WAS FIXED:
========================================

The error "useTheme must be used within ThemeProvider" 
was happening because ThemeToggle was being rendered 
on the server where the context doesn't exist.

Solution: Used Next.js dynamic import with { ssr: false }
to load ThemeToggle only on the client side.

This is the proper way to handle components that need
browser-only features or React Context.

========================================

Need help? The changes are ready - just run deploy.bat!
