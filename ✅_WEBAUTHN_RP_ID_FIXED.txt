✅ WEBAUTHN RP ID ERROR FIXED

PROBLEM:
The relying party ID was being set to window.location.hostname
in server-side code, which caused the error:
"The relying party ID is not a registrable domain suffix..."

FIX APPLIED:
Removed the "id" field from the rp (relying party) configuration.
WebAuthn will now automatically use the current domain.

CHANGES:
- Removed: id: window.location.hostname (server-side code can't access window)
- Now: Browser automatically uses current domain as RP ID

DEPLOYED:
✅ Code committed
✅ Pushed to GitHub
✅ Wait 2-3 minutes for Render deployment

AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Go to /staff/fingerprint-setup
3. Click "Register Fingerprint"
4. Should work without RP ID error

The browser will automatically use the correct domain as the RP ID.
